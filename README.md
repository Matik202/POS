I need to create the kanban mentioned in the call, it must have a connection to the database (mysql), its own stock and interact with the stock.
Initially the kanban must have 4 phases

Example: 

KANBAN ->        received        reviewing      in process      finished 
                 Iphone 11 w/    Iphone 11 w/   Iphone 11 w/    Iphone 11 w/
                 crash display   crash display  crash display   crash display
                 
                 
Process: take from stock display for iphone 11 and subtract it when the item is finished in the kanban 

PD:
